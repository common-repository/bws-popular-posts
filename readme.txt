== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I enable Popular Posts display on my website? =

Please go to Appearance -> Widgets administration page, and look for the widget named Popular Posts Widget.

= I have adjusted the widget settings, and yet nothing is displayed in the widget on the page =

Chances are, you have selected 'views' in 'Order by number of:' block in the widget settings. Since the plugin did not collect the necessary data yet, there is nothing to be displayed. Once the users start visiting your pages, the plugin will keep track, and based on the received statistics, the posts will be displayed in the widget in the frontend.

Please make sure that the problem hasn't been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem's description:

- The link to the page where the problem occurs
- The name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version - your order number.
- The version of your WordPress installation
- Copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wi2X8RdRGXk9kMszQy1xItJrpN0ncXgioH935MaBKtc/edit)
